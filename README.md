---

This is the bytecode implementation for the
[Ribbon](https://ribbon-lang.github.io) programming language. Currently, we are
just exporting zig modules, but later there will be binaries and a C Api.

For the ISA documentation, see [rbc-isa](https://github.com/ribbon-lang/rbc-isa)

For the virtual machine implementation, see [rvm](https://github.com/ribbon-lang/rvm)


## Discussion

Eventually I will create some places for public discourse about the language,
for now you can reach me via:
- Email: noxabellus@gmail.com
- Discord DM, or on various dev servers: my username is `noxabellus`
- For `rbc`-specific inquiries, feel free to create an issue on this repository
